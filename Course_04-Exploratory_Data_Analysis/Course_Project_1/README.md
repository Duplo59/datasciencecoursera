# Exploratory data analysis - Course Project 1
This project folder contains all the information about 'Exploratory Data Analysis' Course Project 1 - a Coursera course by Johns Hopkins University.

Briefly, the goal of the project is to use exploratory graphs in order to understand the data and to develop strategies.
The project uses a [Electric Power Consumption dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) from
[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) which contains 
"*Measurements  of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of 
 almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available*".
 
The dataset contains 9 variables; you can find their description in the [UCI web site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

The goal of the project is to construct four plots named plot1.png, plot2.png, etc, via four 
corresponding R code files. The plots must be identical as the examples supplied (see below):

You can reproduce the graphs; once downloaded the dataset into your current working directory, you can run the R files.
