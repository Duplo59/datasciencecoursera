# Getting and cleaning data - Course Project
This project folder contains all the information about 'Getting and Cleaning Data' Course Project - a Coursera course by Johns Hopkins University.

Briefly, the goal of the project is to:
- retrieve raw data coming from 30 Samsung Galaxy S smartphones weared by 30 volunteers (Human Activity Recognition experiment);
- process the data in order to have a clean and usable data set;
- output the tidy data set to make it available for later analysis steps.

## Overview of the experiment
The goal of the experiment was to analyze data on the physical activity carried out by 30 volunteers in 6 different activities. The data were collected using Samsung S II smartphones. For more information see [HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Available files
The available files are as follows:
- **Codebook.md**: it describes the variables of the final data set ("tidyDataSet.txt") and the steps performed by the R program ("run_analysis.R");
- **Readme.md**: it describes the goal of the project and the experiment;
- **run_analysis.R**: it shows the steps performed to get, transform and clean the data and to create the final tidy data set;
- **tidyDataSet.txt**: it contains the final tidy data set ready for analysis. The files contains 66 variables
about mean and standard deviation, grouped by two identifiers: subjectID, activityDescr

## The R script - 'run_analysis.R'
The script performs the following main tasks:
- **retrieve** and **unzip** the input data set;
- **transforms** and **clean** the data;
- **create** the final tidy data set.

Below, the steps in detail:
1. Step 1 - Set variables and load packages
2. Step 2 - Set variables and load packages
3. Step 3 - Read files to be analyzed
4. Step 4 - Merge test and training data (by row)
5. Step 5 - Consider only the required columns - Create unique data set - Delete temp dataframes
6. Step 6 - Use activity description instead of activity ID
7. Step 7 - Label data set with descriptive variables names
8. Step 8 - Create tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

It is possibile to run the script:
- identify your working directory and store the script in it
- run the script
